UCI Data Analytics Module 4 Assignment

Observations:
1) Concerning the section where we sorted by school spending, size, and type, it is clear that school size correlated the most to whether the overall percentage of students passed or failed.
    The only schools that had an overall pass percentage in the 50's were schools that enrolled students in the highest bracket of student body size.
    There is a tipping point because Wilson High School is technically in the highest student body size bracket, but they spent the least amount of money on their students, but had an average budget for a charter school.
    However, any other high school (namely district schools) were the schools most likely to have a low overall passing percentage correlated to their size. Ford High School has only â‰ˆ 500 more than Wilson, but performed poorly.
    Spending is not correlated with better math/reading/overall passing grades due to district schools spending a large amount per student but falling behind other, smaller schools.

2) Charter schools tended to have better grades across the board compared to district schools regardless of other metrics other than size. Perhaps this is due to the nature of charter schools being more exclusive with their student body.
    It appears only charter schools scored consistently in the upper 80 and 90 percentile while district schools were consistently scoring in the 50's range overall.
    All schools listed had roughly equal reading scores, but math scores are where the largest variance can be seen (7% math compared to 3% reading).
    Despit not spending as much on students, charter schools performed much better than district schools.
